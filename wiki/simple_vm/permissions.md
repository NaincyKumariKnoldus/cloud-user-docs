# Group Permissions

There are two roles within a project: **admins** and **non-admins**.<br> 
Especially for SimpleVM projects, these roles play an expanded role in resource usage authorization.<br> <br> 
An **admins** generally has all rights, not limited to own resources (like vms).<br> 
**Non-admins** are generally only allowed to modify their own resources - unless they have been explicitly granted access.
<br> <br> The following table illustrates the different rights:
