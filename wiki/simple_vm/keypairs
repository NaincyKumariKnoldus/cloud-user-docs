#SSH keys and sharing access

##Basic
You need to set up a ssh key pair in your Profile. This key is needed so you can access the virtual machine via ssh. You should
under no circumstances share your private key with someone.

##Sharing Access
If you want to share access to one of your virtual machines the person you want to share it to needs to give you their public ssh key.
If they do not have one yet, they need to generate it, e.g. using ssh-keygen. After you have obtained their public key you need to
add the key to your virtual machine. This can be done via the following command:

> ssh-copy-id -i {PUBLIC_KEY} -p {PORT} ubuntu@{IP_ADDRESS}

You can find the PORT and the IP_ADDRESS in you virtual machine overview under "Connect Information". PUBLIC_KEY is the name and path of
the public ssh key of the person that you want to share access to.


##Reminder
Please only add the ssh key of people you trust. Furthermore, you are still responsible for the virtual machine if you share your
access with other people.
