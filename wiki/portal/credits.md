# Cloud Credits
The de.NBI Cloud is a cloud federation, providing compute and storage resources free of charge for academics. These resources
are expensive and in high demand which is why they should idle the least amount of time possible. Therefore we employ
'**C**loud **C**redit**s**' (CCS) to assist in your individual responsibility of monitoring your resource usage.  

This page will give you an overview of what CCS are, how we compute and bill them and where you may see your used and 
allocated CCS and how to request more CCS.  

!!! info "Subject to change"
    The usage of Cloud Credits is still in its beginning and therefore subject to change.  
    If you got questions which are not covered on this page or encounter an error, please contact us at cloud@denbi.de

CCS represent the equivalent of computing power and storage per time and have no monetary equivalent. The number of available 
CCS depends on the duration and the choice of resources for a project and are automatically allocated to each project. If
you feel you do not have enough CCS, you may always request more CCS.

## Cloud Credits calculation
We offer a CCS calculator [on this page](https://cloud.denbi.de/creditscalculator/) where you may calculate how many CCS
you need for a flavor configuration over a specified amount of time and how long you may run a flavor configuration 
with a specified amount of CCS.
