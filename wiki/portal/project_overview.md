### Inviting Members

Through invitation links users can be easily added to a de.NBI Cloud project. The process is the following:

* __Step 1__: Send the invitation link which you can find in the "Add Member" modal to the user you want to add (see figure of the previous section).

* __Step 2__: By using this link the user will be requested to register for an ELIXIR and de.NBI Cloud account. In the final step the
user also registers for your project.

* __Step 3__: You will be informed by mail as soon as the user submits an application. You can then approve the application
in the application modal. Once the application is approved the user will have access to your project.

#### Adding a DOI (Digital Object Identifier)
![adding doi](img/adding_doi.png)
In this field you can enter a DOI, which will be associated with your project. There is no limit on the number of DOI you can associate with your project. Clicking the delete Button will remove the DOI and its association to your project.  
If you do not know about DOI, the placeholder [10.1000/182](https://doi.org/10.1000/182) links to the DOI handbook, where you may find more information.  
Please Note that after completion, deletion or termination of your project, the association between the DOI and your project will remain.
