# de.NBI Cloud Freiburg

Welcome to the de.NBI Cloud site Freiburg. Freburg is offering access to cloud resources
via the [Galaxy Gateway](https://galaxyproject.org) and the [European Galaxy server](https://usegalaxy.eu).


## Site specific information

### Get started - the GUI way

The [Galaxy training network](https://training.galaxyproject.org) is providing more than 130 trainings, ready to use on the European Galaxy server with e-learning material. Learn how to start workflows, how you upload thousands of datasets and group them into paired-end collection, directly interact with
ENA or SRA or how you use one of our 2500 tools.

### Get started - the API way

You can control all aspects of Galaxy via a powerful API. The most obvious use-case is to start workflows prgrammatically or via GitHub actions.
Learn more about Galaxy's API and especially the Python Bindings, called bioblend, in the [Galaxy Training Network](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/bioblend-api/) or play around with our [Jupyter Notebooks](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nsoranzo/bioblend-tutorial/master).

### Interactive Tools, Notebooks and virtual Desktops

The Galaxy framework allows us to deploy some nifty things easily in the cloud. Check out https://live.usegalaxy.eu to start your Jupyter Notebook, RStudio instance
or other virtual Desktop or de.NBI projects like Wilson. All of those interactive environments can be combined with Galaxy workflows and you have access to
your Galaxy storage, called histories. This will enable you to combine the best of both worlds, the asynchron world of workflow scheduling and the synchron world of 
Notebook.

### Access to de.NBI cloud Freiburg

You can use Galaxy anonymously if you prefer, but if you want to have persistent storage and run many hundret
jobs in parallel you need to create [an account](https://usegalaxy.eu/login). We recommend to use ELIXIR-AAI for your login.
If you have any questions please contact us at galaxy@informatik.uni-freiburg.de.
